    "Q1. In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that share similar attributes and behavior. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have, but does not actually create the object itself. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that can be manipulated and interacted with, and has its own unique set of values for the properties defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a class called Car that defines the properties and methods of a car. This class might include properties such as make, model, year, and color, as well as methods such as start(), stop(), and accelerate(). An object of this class might be a specific car with the make \"Toyota\", model \"Camry\", year \"2022\", and color \"blue\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: The ability to represent complex real-world systems in a simplified manner, focusing only on the most relevant aspects and ignoring irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: The practice of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world, and providing a clean and simple interface for interacting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting the properties and methods of the parent class and adding or modifying them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability to use objects of different classes in a unified way, by treating them as instances of a common parent class."
